84,Senior UX Designer,"User-experience designers are responsible for creating the look and feel of a specific computer interface. This allows them to navigate the functionality of that interface and produce a certain type of human-computer interaction. These designers generally work on teams, applying their skills to a website or computer product, such as a piece of software. These teams can include different types of designers. 

Interaction designers work primarily with navigation structures and interface functions. Their work is foundational to the site or product being created; every other aspect of the design experience goes on top of their storyboards and mockups for how the design will actually work. The interaction designer is the member of the team that spends the most time with user research, testing and psychology. The information designer deals mainly with content specific to the site or product, as well as working up user assistance tools. The visual designer is concerned with the aesthetics of the final product. 

Despite these differences, user-experience design boils down to the task of translating the requirements for a product's optimal functionality into interactive solutions. This entails the incorporation of market research and psychology, design of the human-computer interface for optimal effectiveness, inclusion of easily navigable content, and graphic design and finishing for maximum aesthetic appeal.

<p>Imagine being surrounded all day by street-smart, confident and quirky people. Even if you&rsquo;re not standing on the sets of &lsquo;How I Met Your Mother&rsquo;. Seriously, the last time a Nearbuy employee called someone Sir, s/he was probably standing in front of a professor explaining the doodle on the note they were passing in class.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;It&rsquo;s also a place where people like to build new stuff (not necessarily out of Lego) and believe in odd things &ndash; like there&rsquo;s something new to be learned every day and that ideas can come from anywhere. Honestly, we love exchanging ideas and everyone has an &lsquo;open-door&rsquo; policy, whether it&rsquo;s your reporting manager or the friendly CEO next door.</p>
<p>Actually, that was a lie &ndash; we don&rsquo;t have an open-door policy. We don&rsquo;t even have doors. We&rsquo;re cool like that.</p>
<p><strong>Fun @ Nearbuy</strong></p>
<p>At Nearbuy (formerly known as Groupon India), fun takes all kinds of bizarre turns. Whether it&rsquo;s odd events (read Twin Day, Halloween Parties, Fashion Disaster, Retro Day), unexpected cake, random photo shoots (if you own a DSLR, you are our new best friend), stand-up comedy one-offs, well, you get the gist. Oh, and we take a very out-of-the-box approach to work. In this case, the box being the office&hellip;Because we have tons of team outings, get togethers and trips. And this is not including the annual offsite where employees from all over the country come together for a weekend of activities, talent shows, dancing, awards, discussions and much more.</p>
<p><strong>Tips from a Nearbuy Veteran</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Everyone needs a friend to stay by their side through late nights. Make coffee yours</li>
<li>That report you stayed up all night preparing? There&rsquo;s a good chance it&rsquo;s going to be scrapped &ndash; we love reinventing and soon you will too (insert evil laugh here)</li>
<li>We believe in casual dressing. But just to be clear, casual doesn't include boxers, feathers, oh god, we're giving you ideas!!!</li>
<li>It may be a bit difficult separating your professional life from your personal life &ndash; because at Nearbuy, it&rsquo;s like working with family. But in a good way</li>

129,Graphic Designer,"<ul>
<li>
<p>You must love fast-paced work environments. Like emergency wards. Only, you know, without people dying and stuff. Because whether it&rsquo;s the demonetization news that broke out at night or the US election results that broke out in the morning, you must be ready with a cup of coffee, and an idea that has the potential to break the internet. No pressure!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You must be a little eccentric to be able to keep up with the pace at which the marketing team comes up with campaigns, and design all the collaterals that go with it</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Do you watch a lot of videos and think you could have made them way better? Well, that&rsquo;s the only kind of arrogance we like! Making, editing sound and video creatively and within budget is a must.</p>
</li>
</ul>","<p><strong>Culture @ Nearbuy </strong></p>
<p>Imagine being surrounded all day by street-smart, confident and quirky people. Even if you&rsquo;re not standing on the sets of &lsquo;How I Met Your Mother&rsquo;. Seriously, the last time a Nearbuy employee called someone Sir, s/he was probably standing in front of a professor explaining the doodle on the note they were passing in class.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;It&rsquo;s also a place where people like to build new stuff (not necessarily out of Lego) and believe in odd things &ndash; like there&rsquo;s something new to be learned every day and that ideas can come from anywhere. Honestly, we love exchanging ideas and everyone has an &lsquo;open-door&rsquo; policy, whether it&rsquo;s your reporting manager or the friendly CEO next door.</p>
<p>Actually, that was a lie &ndash; we don&rsquo;t have an open-door policy. We don&rsquo;t even have doors. We&rsquo;re cool like that.</p>
<p><strong>Fun @ Nearbuy </strong></p>
<p>At Nearbuy (formerly known as Groupon India), fun takes all kinds of bizarre turns. Whether it&rsquo;s odd events (read Twin Day, Halloween Parties, Fashion Disaster, Retro Day), unexpected cake, random photo shoots (if you own a DSLR, you are our new best friend), stand-up comedy one-offs, well, you get the gist. Oh, and we take a very out-of-the-box approach to work. In this case, the box being the office&hellip;Because we have tons of team outings, get togethers and trips. And this is not including the annual offsite where employees from all over the country come together for a weekend of activities, talent shows, dancing, awards, discussions and much more.</p>
<p><strong>Tips from a Nearbuy Veteran</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Everyone needs a friend to stay by their side through late nights. Make coffee yours</li>
<li>That report you stayed up all night preparing? There&rsquo;s a good chance it&rsquo;s going to be scrapped &ndash; we love reinventing and soon you will too (insert evil laugh here)</li>
<li>We believe in casual dressing. But just to be clear, casual doesn't include boxers, feathers, oh god, we're giving you ideas!!!</li>
<li>It may be a bit difficult separating your professional life from your personal life &ndash; because at Nearbuy, it&rsquo;s like working with family. But in a good way</li>

<p>Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of ""de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum"" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular during the Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum, ""Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet.."", comes from a line in section 1.10.32.</p>

<p>There are many variations of passages of Lorem Ipsum available, but the majority have suffered alteration in some form, by injected humour, or randomised words which don't look even slightly believable. If you are going to use a passage of Lorem Ipsum, you need to be sure there isn't anything embarrassing hidden in the middle of text. All the Lorem Ipsum generators on the Internet tend to repeat predefined chunks as necessary, making this the first true generator on the Internet. It uses a dictionary of over 200 Latin words, combined with a handful of model sentence structures, to generate Lorem Ipsum which looks reasonable. The generated Lorem Ipsum is therefore always free from repetition, injected humour, or non-characteristic words etc.</p>
